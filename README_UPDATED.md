TripBro - Prepared Project (UPDATED)

What I did:
- Inserted the provided API key into .env.local:
  - GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyD_DjKAgo9d_LLVYXi5bBQvJE8UWfZTxME
  - VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyD_DjKAgo9d_LLVYXi5bBQvJE8UWfZTxME
- Created a tentative requirements list and an inspection summary.
- Prepared this archive so you can run the project with minimal steps.

How to run (frontend Vite + React):
1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended) and npm or yarn.
2. From project root, run:
   npm install
   npm run dev
3. The app will run on the Vite dev server (usually http://localhost:5173).

If there's a backend (Django) missing: I inspected the archive and this specific zip appears to be a frontend app (Vite + React + TypeScript). I did not find Django backend files. If you have a separate backend zip, provide it and I can integrate.

Notes and next steps I recommend:
- If the project expects a Gemini (OpenAI) key rather than a Google API key, replace GEMINI_API_KEY in .env.local with your Gemini key when available.
- If you want me to create a requirements.txt for a Python backend or add Dockerfile/start scripts, tell me and I'll add them.
- I created a tentative requirements_tentative.txt for Python package guesses; it's likely not needed for this JS frontend.
